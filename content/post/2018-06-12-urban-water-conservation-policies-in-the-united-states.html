<p>Cities face challenges on many fronts as they work to assure their residents of safe and reliable access to water.
Changes in both supply and demand are driven by complex interactions among many human and natural factors, such as
drought, infrastructure, population growth, and land-use. Climate change adds new complexities and uncertainties as
cities plan for the future. In the past, challenges to water security were addressed by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2166/wp.2013.105">Promethean energy- and technology-intensive infrastructure projects</a>,
such as long-distance transfers, desalination, and artificial aquifer recharge;
but in recent years, attention to soft approaches has grown.
<a href="http://pacinst.org/issues/sustainable-water-management-local-to-global/soft-path-for-water/">Soft approaches</a>
to water security focus on improving efficiency in obtaining and consuming water, and as John Fleck
documented in his book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Water-Fighting-Over-Other-Myths-ebook/dp/B01IY20IZ2/"><em>Water Is for Fighting Over</em></a>,
a number of cities have made impressive progress toward resilience and sustaniability.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, I have been part of an interdisciplinary research project to study the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR016943">socio-technical transition of water policy in U.S. cities</a>
from technologically focused measures to expand supply capacity and reliability toward softer measures
that address the demand side through emphasis on efficiency and waste reduction.
We build a [database of water conservation policies] for the 197 largest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area">metropolitan statistical areas</a>
(MSAs) in the United States.
An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area">MSA</a>
is a geogrpahic region representing a central city and one or more contiguous counties that have high population densities
and share economic activity with the central city.</p>

An interactive map of water conservation scores is available at <a href="http://scworland-usgs.github.io/vwci/" class="uri">http://scworland-usgs.github.io/vwci/</a>.
</iframe>
<hr />
<p>We counted the number of categories of water-conservation policy (out of a list of 79 possible categories)
each MSA had adopted. We organized these counts into three conservation scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>VWCI (the Vanderbilt Water Conservation Index): The total number of conservation policies adopted by the MSA.</li>
<li>Requirements: The number of conservation policies that include mandatory requirements, such as prohibiting lawn-watering or requiring that new plumbing installations include low-flow fittings, such as shower heads.</li>
<li>Rebates: The number of policies that offer rebates for voluntary conservation measures, such as purchasing water-efficient appliances.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the table below shows, cities with similar scores for total VWCI mmay have very different contributions from requirements and rebates.
Consider, for instance, New York City and Salt Lake City versus Tampa and Vallejo, El Paso versus Miami, or Riverside versus Fresno.
The table also shows that all but three of the cities with the 20 largest VWCI scores are in the West (of the three exceptions, two are in
Florida and the other is New York City).</p>

<p>In
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2017EF000797">a new paper</a>,
accepted for publication by Earth’s Future, we
analyzed cities in the 48 contiguous states (195 cities from our database, representing 45 states) to
identify the social and environmental characteristics that best predict the number and the kind of
water conservation policies they have adopted. We considered a number of social and environmental variables at the
state-level and at the MSA level.</p>
<ul>
<li>aridity: the Köppen aridity index (negative corresponds to drier climates and positive to wetter climates).</li>
<li>surface water: The fraction of the water supply drawn from surface-water sources.</li>
<li>The Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI): This measures the difference of a city or state’s votes in the 2008 and 2012
presidential elections relative to the national average. Negative values indicate that the city or state voted more
Republican than the national average and positive values indicate that it voted more Democratic.</li>
<li>Real personal income: Average personal income, adjusted for inflation and regional variations in the cost of living.</li>
<li>Population: The population of the metropolitan statistical area.</li>
<li>Population growth rate (measured from 2010 to 2014).</li>
</ul>
<p>For variables that occur at both the city and state level (aridity, surface water, PVI, and RPI), our analysis considered
the state average, and then the difference between the value for the city and the state average, so the regression
coefficients tell us about the effect of the city having a greater or smaller value than the state as a whole. For instance,
for PVI this allows us to consider the effect of a city being more Democratic or Republican than the state (e.g., so-called
“blueberry in tomato soup” cities, as
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/perry-warns-kimmel-i-do-interviews-gun-andrew-johnson/">Rick Perry described Austin TX</a>).</p>
<p>We performed a regression analysis to examine the role of each of these variables in predicting each of the three conservation scores.
The results of the analysis are shown in the figure below.</p>
{{% figure src="/post/img/water-conservation-policies/vwci_cat_plot.png" caption="Regression coefficients for state (&gamma;) and city (&beta;) level variables." %}}
<p>We found that the <strong>aridity</strong> of the state climate was one of the two most important predictors for all three measures of water conservation.
City-level environmental characteristics don’t correlate importantly with the total number of conservation measures, but
we did find that cities that are drier than the rest of the state tend to impose more mandatory conservation requirements.
The greater importance of state-level aridity and the smaller importance of city-level differences from the state average
make sense when we consider that city water supplies tend to be drawn from drainage basins and aquifers that extend far
beyond the urban boundaries. <strong>Surface water</strong> was not an important predictor for any of the conservation measures
at either the state or city level.</p>
<p>Of the social variables, <strong>PVI</strong> was important at both the state and city level. Cities in more Democratic states, and
cities that vote more Democratic than the rest of the state tend to adopt more total conservation measures and more
of each kind of conservation measure. However, as we describe in the paper, an alternate analysis whose results are
equally plausible as the one we present here, found that if we look at the city’s raw PVI value, as opposed to
the difference between the city and the state, then the city’s PVI is a very important predictor of water conservation,
but the state-level PVI becomes ambiguous and less important. Either way, both analyses find that PVI is an important
predictor, but differ on the details of the distinction between city-level and state-level PVI.</p>
<p>Urban population and population growth rate are both important, with larger and faster-growing cities adopting more conservation measures of all kinds.</p>
<p>Most of the variables that had significant predictive power affected all the conservation measures in the same way: cities in more arid states,
cities that vote more Democratic, and cities with larger and faster-growing populations tend to adopt more total conservation measures,
more requirements, and more rebates. However, two variables predict different mixtures of conservation measures.
Cities that are drier than the rest of the state tend to adopt more mandatory conservation requirements relative to the number of
voluntary rebates and other measures. And cities in less affluent states (those with lower state-wide real personal income) tended to
adopt more rebates relative to the number of requirements and other measures.</p>
