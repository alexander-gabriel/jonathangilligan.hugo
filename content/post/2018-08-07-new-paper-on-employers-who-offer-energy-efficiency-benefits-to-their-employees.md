I have a [new paper](/publications/maki_2018_employee_benefits/) in the journal
_Energy Efficiency_, co-authored with Alex Maki, Emmett McKinney, 
Mike Vandenbergh, and Mark Cohen, 
about employers who offer employee benefits to promote energy efficiency.

The paper draws on a combination of reports
by employers and a survey of 482 people about what energy-efficiency benefits
their employers offer and their opinions about such benefits.

The survey found that 17% of employees are offered some kind of energy-efficiency
benefits, and employees value these both for financial reasons (saving money on
energy bills) and because they care about the environment.

We also found that employees who work for employers that offer energy-efficiency
benefits report higher job satisfaction, even after controlling for factors such
as income, job classification, and access to other (more traditional) types of
benefits.
