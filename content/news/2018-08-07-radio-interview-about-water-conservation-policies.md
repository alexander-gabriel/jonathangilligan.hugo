I was recently interviewed for _The Show_ on KJZZ in Phoenix about my recent
paper on urban water conservation policies in the U.S.

# Do A City's Politics Impact Its Water Conservation Policies?

How much do the voting habits of a city’s residents affect that city’s water 
conservation policies?
Researchers have tried to find out, by putting together a database of nearly 
200 American cities and their conservation policies. They then looked at other 
characteristics of those cities, including climate, local economy, how arid it 
is and growth rate, and then looked how those cities voted in presidential 
elections.

[The results](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2017EF000797) 
show Phoenix has fewer conservation policies in place than researchers would 
have otherwise expected.

Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental sciences and civil 
and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt University and lead author of the 
study, joined _The Show_ to talk about it.
