### Description

How can private industry make the quickest impact on climate change?

Sometimes, the law cannot solve a problem or, when it comes to climate change, 
arguably the biggest problem our country faces.  Michael, an environmental lawyer, 
and Jonathan, a climate scientist, join the show today to talk about a book they 
recently co-authored called, 
[_Beyond Politics: The Private Governance Response to Climate Change_](https://beyondpoliticsbook.com). 
In their book, they argue that the private sector, not the government, provides 
the biggest potential for making a significant difference in climate change in 
the short term. Michael and Jonathan discuss the background of the climate crisis 
we face and why, they argue, we cannot afford to wait for the federal government 
to take action to address the crisis.  Fortunately, some major American businesses 
are already making significant progress in reducing their carbon footprint to help 
limit the effects of climate change.
