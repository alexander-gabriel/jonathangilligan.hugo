  amorphous silicon
volume: '299'
---
Using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy, we report detailed measurements of the fundamental absorption threshold below the optical gap in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). These measurements suggest that the density of neutral defects is much greater than the densities of charged defects in intrinsic a-Si:H. The positions and widths of the corresponding transition energies are determined and agree with two models proposed to describe the density of states in a-Si:H.
